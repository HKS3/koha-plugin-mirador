# Introduction

The Koha Plugin Mirador integrates the Mirador image viewer with Koha, an open-source Integrated Library System (ILS). This plugin enhances Koha's capabilities by allowing users to view and interact with high-resolution images directly within the Koha OPAC interface.

With this plugin you are able to display digital assets directly within the Koha OPAC interface, and use the catalog data from Koha serve IIIF manifests, needed for IIIF viewers to display digital assets. Integrated in this plugin is the [Mirador viewer](https://projectmirador.org/)
